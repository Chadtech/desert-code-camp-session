render := 
  0 remove all the html
  1 make new html

PROBLEM. this is very costly in terms of CPU cycles, and wasteful considering most of the time, most of the html isnt changing.


SOLUTION. only change what needs to be changed.

render :=
  0 generate a virtual DOM, and then compare it to the html
  1 Identify differences between the virtual dom and the html
  2 Make those changes to the Html
  3 forget about the Virtual DOM

Html              VDOM
  div               div
    p "cool"          p "cool"
    p "dog"           p "cat"
    p "man"

changes =
  0 The VDOMs div no longer has a third child
  1 The child of the second p is "cat" and not "dog"

render( changes ) =
  0 Remove the divs third child
  1 Remove the second p tags text node and replace it with "cat"
